# Hack&Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Inspiration

We started to create a game, but we quickly came to the realization that what we really wanted was to disconnect, and we were playing physical games such as chess. So we thought, why don't we find a way to make people come togethere, help hackers meet new people in an easy way. We bet they will find a way to have fun from the myriad of possibilities of enterntainment that exist today, and maybe it doesn't have to be through a screen.

## What it does

The Hack&Game web application helps you meet other hackers in different ways:
- By finding a random opponent that is also looking to meet up with someone. When scanning your QR, if someone is also looking to meet, you will be given his slack handle.
- If you are with a group of hackers, one can create a room by scanning his QR and the others can join said room by also scanning the creator's QR.
- Simply ask someone to scan his QR at the main page tab

At the beginning of the Hackathon, the "HackU" virus will be on some lucky hackers, and every connection they make, they will propagate it. When the time expires, everyone will be able to see the graph of infections generated.

## How we built it

We used the most popular Javascript framework for web development, React.Using functional components, and with the help of some libraries such as bootstrap. We managed the project through Github, working on different branches, and merging the changes when needed.

## Challenges we ran into

We had never built a react web-app, and we were only familiar with html-js-css, so it was very hard to get started, and we had to constantly learn about what we were building. We also tried to build full-stack with the MERN stack, which we also had never used, but we realized that not enough time was given to fully implement it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Designing, and building a web app, that we would, as hackers, use as a way to rest and meet new people. It is designed mainly for mobile use, and it is fully responsive in both ways. We also managed to finish every look of the web, without leaving any page too unattended.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about react, how cool it is to create/reuse components, hooks such as the useState... etc.

## What's next for Hack&Game

We hope for all Hackers interested in the project to come and give us feedback. We've already talked to some, but since we want this to be used by every hacker, we want it to be feature complete. And finally, we would love to have this as a web-app, or as a part of the hackupc app next year! ;)
