                    There have been some lucky hackers who have been selected to
                    carry the "nomvirus". Every time they make a new connection,
                    the "nomvirus" is transmitted. <br/>
                    At the end of the Hackathon, you will see how the "nomvirus"
                    has expanded in a graph-like display and you can even check your
                    Erd√∂s number with other participants. <br/>
                    Connections can be made by finding a random opponent, participating
                    or creating a room (which makes all possible connections) or simply
                    by clicking Scan.
                </p>

            <Button variant="primary" size="lg" onClick={() => navigate('/scan')}>

            </Button>
